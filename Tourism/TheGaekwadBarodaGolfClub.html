      <p class="para">
        <strong>About the location:</strong>  Established in the early 1990’s, the Gaekwad Baroda Golf Club is the only private golf course in and around Vadodara. But more than that, it has earned the reputation of being one of the most prestigious clubs in Gujarat. This premier club was founded by the erstwhile royal family of Baroda. Befittingly, the Lakshmi Villas Palace makes a gorgeous backdrop Vilas Palace, an extravagant building, was built by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III in 1890. It remains the residence of the royal family, who continue to be held in high esteem by the residents of Vadodara.  In the 1990s Ranjitsinh Pratapsinh Gaekwad’s grandson Samartjitsinh, a former Ranji trophy cricket player, renovated the course and opened it to the public.

        The historical Motibaug Palace, built as a guesthouse to compliment the Lakshmi Villas, is in fact an older monument than the famed Lakshmi Villas itself. Possibly built initially to house all the British architects and engineers who built Lakshmi Villas, this palace in the 1950-60’s was also the residence to Pratapsinhrao Gaekwad. This 15,000 sq. ft. home has now been converted into the main clubhouse of Gaekwad Baroda Golf Club. The open verandah on both the ground and first floor open up onto the golf course. This clubhouse houses a well stocked Pro-shop, a verandah Café lounge, a conference room and a fine dining multi-cuisine restaurant on the upper floor. Located in the heart of Vadodara, this magnificent property is frequented by the who’s who of the city and around. And as members and visitors soak in the historical surrounding they are greeted by a warm and  friendly staff.

        Gaekwad Baroda Golf Club is essentially a golf club and maintains that character even while affording facilities for other sports. The club facilities include tennis, badminton, gym and a large swimming pool for complete family recreation. Memberships are restricted and there is a waiting period for applicants before they can join the prestigious club. But from beginner to pro, Gaekwad Baroda Golf Club offers everything a golf enthusiast could possibly want or need. The club is also keen to serve the interests of all golf enthusiasts and also to inculcate a keen interest in golf in non-golfers. In the serene scenery learning and playing golf can transform into a truly delightful experience. The membership programme thus includes basic coaching to help new members pick up the game and start playing on the course. New members are also guided by pros about the rules and etiquette of the game.
