      <p class="para">
        <strong>About the location:</strong>  Still the residence of Vadodara’s royal family, Laxmi Vilas was built in full-throttle 19th-century Indo-Saracenic flourish at a cost of Rs 6 million. Built over 500 acres, this is the largest private home built till date and four times the size of Buckingham Palace. The most impressive Raj-era palace in Gujarat, its elaborate interiors boast well-maintained mosaics, chandeliers and artworks, as well as a highly impressive collection of weaponry and art. Paintings by the famous artist, Raja Ravi Verma who was specially commissioned by the then Maharaja of Baroda, adorn the palace. It’s set in expansive park-like grounds, which include a golf course. The Navlakhi stepwell in the premises is a window to the ancient water resource system built by kings to overcome the parched lands of Gujarat. Other buildings within the complex include the LVP Banquets & Conventions, Moti Baug Palace and the Maharaja Fateh Singh Museum building. This is also home to the Moti Bagh Cricket Ground, the offices of the Baroda Cricket Association and a rare indoor teak floored tennis court and badminton court.
